# Master Detail 

A utility process with one master dialog(with detail view) and a stand-alone detail dialog to implement a master detail scenario with Ivy and Primefaces.

## Demo

Axon Ivy's Master-detail interface best-practice example is designed to accelerate process automation initiatives by demonstrating the flexible and powerful UI possibilities. This example showcases the following features:
* Three different approaches to implementing the Master-Detail Pattern are demonstrated based on the project's complexity. These approaches involve utilizing different process elements, UI views, and modal dialogs.

* Streamlining UI challenges for both professional developers and low coders, this example provides guidance on efficiently implementing the Master-Detail interface.

* This best-practice example is a valuable resource for resolving [Master-Detail interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93detail_interface) requirements in any process automation project.


## Setup

 - You only need to start the test process: `Create Test Data Repo`. This will create some products in the business repo in order that the products table is initialized with data.
